# Revamp-SLA-for-Cross-Border-Service
A project to simulate and propose new Service Level Agreements (SLA) based on actual lead time distribution of cross-border logistics.

## 📌 Objective
To redesign SLA standards for better alignment with real performance and customer expectations, especially after outperforming previous SLA baselines.

## ⚙️ Features
- Historical lead time analysis
- On-time performance distribution chart
- Adjustable SLA thresholds for simulation
- Proposal template for regional alignment

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Import delivery lead time data into Google Sheets.
2. Script calculates percentiles and current SLA compliance.
3. Visual chart supports proposal of new SLA (e.g., from 90% → 95% on-time).

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Google Sheets
- Google Apps Script
- Google Charts
